# PaleoFlow
### High-Fidelity Metabolic Tracking | Version 3.4

**PaleoFlow** is a minimalist, proprietary command center designed to monitor the metabolic transition from glucose-dependency to peak autophagy and cellular regeneration. Optimized for OLED displays, it provides a persistent, real-time visualization of the biological state across a 120-hour (5-day) spectrum.

## 🧬 Update History (履歴)

### v3.1 – v3.4: Spectrum Wave & Milestone HUD (Current)
* **Sequential Spectrum Wave**: Implemented a dynamic linear-gradient wave in the **BIO-SHIFT** label that only unlocks colors as the user conquers each specific phase.
* **Milestone Range HUD**: Redesigned the interaction buttons into pill-shaped milestones displaying exact hour ranges (e.g., `16-24h`) for tactical navigation.
* **Kinetic Pulse Logic**: Integrated a dynamic animation frequency that accelerates from a 4s "Breath" to a 1s "Heartbeat" as a metabolic milestone approaches.
* **Brand Consolidation**: Finalized the **PaleoFlow** nomenclature across all UI elements and documentation.

### v2.0 – v3.0: The Protocol Expansion
* **Protocol Field Reports**: Overhauled button popups into the « Biological Vector », « Sensory Feedback », and « Protocol Caution » structured reporting system.
* **Start Fasting Workflow**: Added the retroactive entry system with the **Time-Travel Guard** to prevent future-dated log corruption.
* **The HUD Layout**: Introduced the 10-phase flanking button architecture and OLED-optimized "Perfect Black" dashboard.

### v1.0 – v1.9: Foundation
* Initial 5-ring concentric SVG dashboard architecture.
* 10-phase biological logic implementation and LocalStorage persistence.

## 🛠 Features & Architecture

### « Biological Vector » System
The application features ten distinct sub-phases, each with a custom scientific data profile:
* **Vector Data**: Molecular-level cellular mechanics.
* **Sensory Feedback**: Predictive physical and mental state tracking.
* **Protocol Caution**: Safety alerts, electrolyte requirements, and refeeding hazard mitigation.

### Visual HUD Mechanics
* **OLED Optimization**: 0% black-point backgrounds for minimal battery draw on Samsung S23 Ultra hardware.
* **Concentric Rings**: Each ring represents a 24-hour biological cycle, with color-mapping tied to metabolic intensity.
