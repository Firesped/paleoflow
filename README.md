### High-Fidelity Metabolic Tracking | Version 3.4

**PaleoFlow** is a minimalist, bio-hacking command center designed to track the metabolic transition from glucose-dependency to peak autophagy and cellular regeneration. Optimized for OLED displays, it provides a persistent, real-time visualization of your biological state across a 120-hour (5-day) spectrum.

## 🚀 Version 3.4: Spectrum Wave HUD
The latest update introduces a dynamic visual narrative to your metabolic progress:
* **Sequential Spectrum Wave**: The **BIO-SHIFT** label now features a flowing linear-gradient wave that only contains the colors of the phases you have successfully completed.
* **Milestone HUD**: Interaction buttons are now pill-shaped and display the exact hour ranges (e.g., `16-24h`) for better tactical navigation.
* **Dynamic Pulse Logic**: The Bio-Shift wave frequency accelerates as you approach a cellular milestone, providing kinetic feedback on your progress.

## 🧬 Biological Roadmap (The 10 Phases)

| Phase | Window | Status | Primary Vector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | 0-4h | **ANABOLIC** | Nutrient processing and insulin management. |
| **02** | 4-16h | **CATABOLIC** | Glycogen depletion and fat mobilization. |
| **03** | 16-24h | **TRANSITION** | The GNG Switch; shifting to internal glucose creation. |
| **04** | 24-36h | **DEEP KETOSIS** | BHB crossing the blood-brain barrier. |
| **05** | 36-48h | **KETO-ADAPTED** | Optimized fat-burning and inflammation reduction. |
| **06** | 48-60h | **AUTOPHAGY I** | Bulk recycling of damaged organelles (Macro-autophagy). |
| **07** | 60-72h | **AUTOPHAGY II** | Precision protein cleaning (CMA Autophagy). |
| **08** | 72-96h | **IMMUNE RESET** | Stem cell signaling and WBC recycling. |
| **09** | 96-120h | **CENTURION** | Peak repair velocity and growth hormone elevation. |
| **10** | 120h+ | **MASTER** | Elite metabolic flexibility and longevity state. |

## 🛠 Features

### « Biological Vector » Reports
Every phase button provides a detailed field report, broken into:
* **Biological Vector**: What your cells are doing at a molecular level.
* **Sensory Feedback**: What physical and mental sensations to expect.
* **Protocol Caution**: Specific safety warnings, electrolyte needs, and refeeding hazards.

### Safety Guardrails
* **Time-Travel Guard**: Prevents future-dated logs from corrupting ring calculations.
* **Start Fasting Workflow**: Allows for retroactive entry of your last meal time.
* **Refeeding Awareness**: Integrated warnings for high-risk re-entry after prolonged flows.
