# PaleoFlow (MVP)

**PaleoFlow** is a minimalist metabolic state tracker designed to manage the "Wave" between feeding (**Build**) and fasting (**Flow**) windows. Built for precise metabolic control, it provides predictive modeling for ketosis milestones.

## 🚀 Current Features (v1.0)
- **Dynamic State Engine:** Switches between "Flow" and "Build" with localized persistence.
- **Predictive Metabolic Phases:** Real-time feedback on transition states (Anabolic → Catabolic → Ketosis).
- **Integrated Biomarker Logs:** Manual entry and editing for Glucose (mg/dL) and Ketones (Blood, Breath, Urine).
- **Local-First Privacy:** Data resides exclusively on the user's device.

## ⚖️ Terms of Service & Disclaimer
### 1. Medical Disclaimer
PaleoFlow is a data-tracking tool and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
